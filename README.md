# Software-Composition-Analysis-SCA-tools
This repository is dedicated to hosting and showcasing Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools. SCA tools help identify vulnerabilities, outdated packages, and license compliance issues in third-party and open-source dependencies used within your application.

üîç What is SCA?
Software Composition Analysis is a method used to automatically detect and manage risks in the open-source components of your software stack. These tools scan your project's dependency tree and alert you to known vulnerabilities based on public vulnerability databases (such as CVE, NVD, etc.).
